# MoneyMitra

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

The financial app aims to assist small businesses in acquiring loans through a streamlined and efficient process. The app prompts the user to provide necessary information such as annual revenue, 2-month revenue, profitability, and business details such as type and location. The data is then analyzed by the app's backend to calculate important metrics such as CAGR, cash flow, and ROI to determine the user's eligibility for the loan.

To further assess the user's business potential, the app uses the user's pin code and address to evaluate the growth opportunity based on the area's market conditions. This is achieved by analyzing various factors such as the number of similar businesses in the vicinity, the spending habits of the area's residents, per capita merchant income of the state, and sector growth indicators from credible online sources.

The app's advanced algorithm uses this data to calculate a growth score that inversely correlates with the number of competitors in the area. A high growth score indicates significant potential for expansion and growth. Additionally, the app provides valuable insights and suggestions to help businesses optimize their operations and increase their chances of success.

The app's administration interface provides a user-friendly platform for loan processing and approval. The app's algorithm ensures transparency and accuracy in the loan approval process, leading to a higher success rate and increased customer satisfaction. The app's unique features, such as the growth score and valuable insights, make it an ideal financial app for small businesses looking to grow and expand.

Future goals: Introducing AI and machine learning algorithms to the app to provide more personalized financial guidance to users. The app will be able to analyze user data and provide customized financial advice based on the user's financial goals and spending habits.

Building partnerships with local businesses and financial institutions to offer exclusive deals and discounts to app users. This will provide additional value to users while also creating new revenue streams for the app.

Incorporating a social networking feature that allows small business owners to connect with each other, share advice, and collaborate on projects. This will create a community-driven platform that encourages small business growth and success
